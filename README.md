###Theme, Narrative, or Metaphor

**Story**: The main character is on a safari trip when he/she/they wander off from their safari group and get lost. Left with only a backpack, a safari guidebook and a digital camera, the player has to find their way back to the group. The Character will have to traverse through the safari and solve puzzles to get their way back to the group. An example is where you lure a certain safari carnivore by getting them distracted with one of their preys. The guidebook is going to act like either an information journal or a puzzle helper.

The animals that will be focused on are from the Ruaha Carnivore project and include wild dogs, cheetahs, and lions. Out of these three carnivores, the Woodland Park Zoo currently houses African Lions but none of the others.

**Description of Player Actions and Decisions**:
Because the player is lost and without a way to communicate with anyone, they are left only with a few items in their backpack. These items change, move  based on the situation.
**Educational Considerations**:
Prior Knowledge or Skills Required (if any):  None. The purpose of the game is to educate the player on the Ruaha project. The actual gameplay will be very simple and the only skills needed will be the ability to read or have someone read for them. 
Learning Outcomes (content related or process related and/or scaffolded externally, esp. if your answer below is in school): The game will provide simple facts about the animals that the player encounters including how the Ruaha project is protecting them. 
Target Play Setting (if any; e.g., in school or out of school):   Preferably at the Zoo near the Lion exhibit is or near other African animals.
